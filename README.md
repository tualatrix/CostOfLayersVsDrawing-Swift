## The swift version for [CostOfLayersVsDrawing](https://github.com/floriankugler/CostOfLayersVsDrawing)

This is a test project to profile graphics performance on different iOS devices. 

It can be configured to use views composed of subviews, composed of sublayers or drawn as a flat bitmap with Core Graphics. Furthermore it can be used to measure how quickly a view can be brought onto screen and how smoothly an existing layer tree can be animated.
